# 🎯 Smart Attendance System using Face Detection with OpenCV  
### 👨‍💻 Software Engineering Mini Project  

---

## 📚 Libraries Used:

- **NumPy** – Powerful Python library for numerical computing, offering support for multi-dimensional arrays and a wide range of mathematical operations.  
- **Pandas** – A fast, flexible, and expressive tool for data manipulation and analysis built on top of Python.  
- **Haar Cascade Classifier** – A machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify faces in images and videos. Based on the work of Paul Viola and Michael Jones (2001).  
- **face_recognition** – The world’s simplest library for face recognition in Python, allowing easy face detection and manipulation.  
- **OpenCV** – A highly optimized open-source library for real-time computer vision and image processing.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project:

### 🔧 Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.x installed
2. A code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

---

### 🛠️ Setup Instructions:
1. Clone or download the project from this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install all required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

### ▶️ Run the Application:
1. Open your terminal in the project directory.
2. Install **Streamlit** (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```
3. Launch the app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    ✅ **This will automatically open a new tab in your default web browser where the application UI will start running.**
